# dqn-pong
A Deep-Q Neural Network implementation to solve the Gym's Atari Pong environment, more specifically, 'PongNoFrameskip-v4'. The automated opponent's movements are too predicatble hence the agent has bsaically found a hack to keep beating it using actions that put it into the state where it knows its assured victory form. Work to improve and work around this loop is currently under progress, until future versions of the same. Several wrapper classes have been implemented to make the environment more suitable to be learnt by the Double DQN approach as released by the DeepMind community. Current version 0.1.2
